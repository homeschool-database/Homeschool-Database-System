# User Documentation

The goal of this home school database system is to provide a quick, simple, and easy management system for parents of homeschooled high school students to keep track of their information digitally.

## Installation

Two other softwares are required before the installation of this software.

[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) and [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-installing.html).

Follow the links above.

Your MySQL and MySQL Workbench should be fully configured and operational before continuing the installation process.

Return here once you have finished.

1) Download the latest version of our software from our GitHub and unzip its contents.

2) Start your MySQL server.

3) Start up MySQL Workbench and connect to your local host.

4) Open the "create_school.sql" script in MySQL Workbench and run the entire script.

At this point our database is fully installed and configured to its base functionality.

## MySQL Workbench

The main user interface to interact with our software will be through MySQL Workbench.

Much of the interface is self-explanatory in its functinality, but several keys functions will be highlighted.

1) In the upper left corner there are two buttons to create and open new .sql files.

2) Within the query ediotr there is a disk symbol the save the current file and a lightning bolt symbol to run the file.

3) Under the Schemas tab, you can reload and also view all your databases. This is useful in familearizing yourself with the design of the database

## Using the Database

To make changes to and insert new data into the database follow these basic steps.

It should also be noted as this is a database, the user should be familier with basic MySQL database commands.

More information: [Getting Started](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/), [Reference Manual](URL), and [MySQL Statements](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-statements.html)

1) Inside MySQL Workbench, create a new sql file, name it, and save it where it is accessible.

2) Design your MySQL query and then save it.

3) Run the query to make changes to the database.
